# Churn Analysis and Prediction Repository
This repository focuses on the analysis of Churn (customer attrition) using Python within Google Colab. The project utilizes popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly Express, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Overview
The main objective is to analyze and predict customer churn using a Decision Tree Classifier. The process involves importing, cleaning, and exploring the dataset, followed by feature engineering and model creation.

# Technologies Used
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly Express
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Key Steps

- Data Import and Cleaning: Utilize Pandas for importing and cleaning the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore data patterns and relationships using Plotly Express, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Feature Engineering: Prepare data for modeling by creating relevant features.
- Model Creation: Utilize Scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier to build a predictive model.
- Model Evaluation: Assess model accuracy using Scikit-learn's accuracy_score metric.
- Visualization: Visualize the Decision Tree using Scikit-learn's tree module.

# Environment
The analysis and model development are conducted in Google Colab, leveraging its collaborative and cloud-based capabilities.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own Churn analysis projects!
